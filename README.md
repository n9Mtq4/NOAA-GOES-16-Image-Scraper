# NOAA GOES (GOES-16, GOES-17) Image Scraper

## About
This is a tiny program that scrapes and downloads images from 
NOAA's GOES East or West satellites. As of December 18, 2017, GOES-13 has
been retired from the GOES east position and been replaced with
GOES-16. This program is an updated version of [GOES-13](https://github.com/n9Mtq4/NOAA-Goes-13-image-scraper)
that works with GOES-16 and GOES-17.
The point of this project is to be able to keep a locally
stored database of these images, so you can look back further than
the image limit of the online directory list.

NOAA's site with the images can be found [here](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php).

## Running
1. Obtain a compiled jar file: See the "Building from source" instructions or head over the [releases page](https://github.com/n9Mtq4/NOAA-Goes-16-image-scraper/releases).
2. cd to the directory containing the jar file. The images will also be downloaded in this directory.
3. run the JarFileName.jar with `java -jar JarFileName.jar \[OPTIONS\]`.
4. The images will appear in a newly created "./imgs/" directory.

## Timestamp explanation
The images are labeled with a timestamp from NOAA. The timestamps are in **UTC** time.
The format of these timestamps are `YYYYDDDHHMM`. `YYYY` is the 4 digit year, `DDD` is the
number of days that have past since the start of the year (Jan 1 is 001). `HHMM` is the hour and minute.

An example might be `20181132152`. This timestamp was from the year 2018, day #113 and at 21:52 UTC,
or April 23, 2018 at 21:52 UTC.

## Recommended ffmpeg options for timelapse
If you wish to make a timelapse from this programs output, here is an ffmpeg command that I
recommend (for 5424x5424px), change the bitrate (-b:v) as needed.

`ffmpeg -framerate 30 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpg' -c:v libx264 -b:v 20MB -maxrate 20MB -bufsize 100MB video.mp4`
