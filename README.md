# NOAA Goes 16 Image Scraper

## About
This is a tiny program that scrapes and downloads images from 
NOAA's GOES east satellite. As of December 18, 2017, GOES-13 has
been retired from the GOES east position and been replaced with
GOES-16. This program is an updated version of [GOES-13](https://github.com/n9Mtq4/NOAA-Goes-13-image-scraper)
that works with GOES-16.
The point of this project is to be able to keep a locally
stored database of these images, so you can look back further than
the ~44 image limit of the online directory list.

NOAA's site with the images can be found [here](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES/index.php).
